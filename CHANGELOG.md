# Changelog

## 2025-10-17

- Updated Google OAuth flow and local dev tooling for `frontend/`.
- Implemented dynamic OAuth redirect handling to prevent 404s and redirect_uri mismatches.

### Changes
- `frontend/worker/index.ts`
  - Build `redirect_uri` dynamically from the incoming request origin in `handleOAuthCallback()`.
  - Use computed `redirect_uri` during token exchange.
  - Integrated Xata persistence using REST (no generated types).
  - Upsert `public.Users` with `id`, `email`, `name`, and `imageUrl`.
  - Upsert `public.SocialConnections` with deterministic `id = "${provider}:${providerId}"`, plus `userId`, `provider`, `providerId`, `email`, `name`.
  - Normalized avatar field to `imageUrl` in OAuth return payload.
  - Added `USE_MOCK_AUTH` env flag to disable localhost mock by default.
- `frontend/src/components/GoogleLoginButton.tsx`
  - Build `redirect_uri` using `VITE_WORKER_ORIGIN` with fallback to `window.location.origin`.
  - Switch Google authorize endpoint to `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`.
- `frontend/vite.config.ts`
  - Conditionally include `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` using `VITE_DISABLE_CF_PLUGIN` via `loadEnv` to avoid Miniflare port conflicts during `vite dev`.
- `frontend/package.json`
  - Add `concurrently` and new scripts to launch Vite and Wrangler together.
  - Set `VITE_DISABLE_CF_PLUGIN=1` for `dev:client` to ensure plugin is disabled during dev.
  - Add `@types/node` to devDependencies.
- `frontend/.env.local` (developer env)
  - Documented recommended entries: `VITE_WORKER_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8787`, `VITE_DISABLE_CF_PLUGIN=1`, and `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`.
- `.windsurf_plan.md`
  - Added project plan with dev/prod OAuth guidance and deployment notes.
- `frontend/wrangler.jsonc`
  - Fixed Wrangler error by adding SPA not_found handling.
  - Updated production assets to serve from `./dist/` to avoid 404 at root after deploy.
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
  - Display user avatar when authenticated using `user.imageUrl` with placeholder fallback.
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx`
  - Remove auto-redirect for authenticated users from `/` to `/dashboard`; Home is now accessible when logged in.
  - Render `TopNavigation` so the top-right account menu is visible on the homepage when logged in.
- Branding & Copy updates
  - Home hero title changed to "Simple Social Thing" and subheading reframed to value-driven copy.
  - Removed technology logos from Home; footer copy now highlights product benefits.
  - Browser title and meta description updated in `frontend/index.html`.
- UI/Navigation
  - Top brand changed to link to `/` and read "Simple Social Thing".
  - Center nav now shows `Home / Features / Contact`; added pages and routes.
  - Account menu moved actions into dropdown; avatar/name links to `/dashboard`.
  - Improved dropdown UX: hover to open, stronger hover/focus states, removed hover gap.
  - Always-visible vertical scrollbar to prevent layout shift.
- Pages
  - Added `frontend/src/pages/Features.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/Contact.tsx` (with form).
- SPA Routing (Cloudflare Workers)
  - Bound static assets with `binding: ASSETS` in `wrangler.jsonc` and delegated non-API requests in `worker/index.ts` to enable client-side routes (e.g., `/dashboard`).
- Auth UX
  - Synchronous auth hydration from `localStorage` in `AuthContext` to eliminate header flash. Only show loading during OAuth callback processing.
- Fonts
  - Preconnected and loaded Inter via `<link>` in `index.html`; removed CSS `@import` to reduce flash.
- Visual polish
  - Prevented H1 descender clipping on Home by adjusting line-height/padding.
- Database
  - Added column `imageUrl text` to `public.Users`.

### Notes
- Ensure Google OAuth client has Authorized redirect URI:
  - Dev: `http://localhost:8787/api/auth/google/callback`
  - Prod: `https://<your-worker-domain>/api/auth/google/callback`
- Start dev: `npm run dev` (client on 5173, worker on 8787).
